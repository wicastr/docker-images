## Base Alpine container
These images are made to be used on [WICASTR](https://wicastr.com) certified Edge Computing hardware combined with the [WICASTR platform](https://cloud.wicastr.net) for easy installation and maintenance of applications at the Edge.
However they could also be used in other environments.

## What is Alpine Linux?
[Alpine Linux](http://alpinelinux.org/) is a Linux distribution built around [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org/) and [BusyBox](http://www.busybox.net/). The image is only 5 MB in size and has access to a [package repository](http://forum.alpinelinux.org/packages) that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images. This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications. [Read more about Alpine Linux here](https://www.alpinelinux.org/about/) and you can see how their mantra fits in right at home with Docker images.
